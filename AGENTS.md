# Agent Handoff

Welcome! To continue the CDK-to-Pulumi CLI prototype:

1. Read `spec.md` for the full implementation plan and TODO checklist.
2. Update the checklist in `spec.md` as you complete tasks.
3. Keep this file up to date if the handoff process changes.

Thanks and good luck!

## Status Updates

- See `spec.md` for the authoritative implementation plan, checklist, and latest status.
- Remember to commit frequently as you land logical chunks so handoffs stay easy to follow.
