# Agent Handoff

Welcome! To continue the CDK-to-Pulumi CLI prototype:

1. Read `spec.md` for the full implementation plan and TODO checklist.
2. Update the checklist in `spec.md` as you complete tasks.
3. Keep this file up to date if the handoff process changes.

Thanks and good luck!

## Status Updates

- Scaffolded the `packages/cdk-convert-core` package with its own `package.json`, tsconfig, and placeholder source; updated root TypeScript configs (`tsconfig.base.json`, `tsconfig.build.json`) plus build scripts to compile both projects.
